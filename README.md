# CS230-Portfolio

The Gaming Room wants to make a game called Draw It or Lose It with an Android game already created.

In my documentation, I found it pretty easy to separate the requirements for what the client wanted, and where they should target. I found the software design template very handy so I didn't have to format everything.

If I were to revise anything, I would add more detail to the software design template. 

The client wanted to develop a game for platform I recommended and I chose the Windows platform. It is important to consider the client's needs because each operating platform has advantages/disadvantages and some work better than others for the desired usage.
